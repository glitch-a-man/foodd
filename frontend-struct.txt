Project Goal

Restructure the existing project into a clean, flow-driven food delivery web app where:

Users discover food through reels and can order in one tap.

The project currently feels cluttered. The goal is to reorganize the frontend by page intention and user flow, not by components or existing code.

There are three user modes:

Guest (not logged in)

Logged-in User (customer)

Restaurant Owner (admin)

The routing and pages must reflect these modes clearly.

Important Rules for Restructuring

Do not mix responsibilities of pages.

Each page represents a clear user intention.

Pages not yet implemented must show only placeholder descriptive text.

Focus on clean routing and separation, not UI design yet.

Reels Feed is the core of the app, but not the home page.
